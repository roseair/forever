<h4>
If you’re looking for forever, I’ll take the batteries out of my clocks, so we would be stuck inside this moment, as if time has really stopped. I would tell you that I love you every second, except here, seconds do no exist. So I’ll say I love you with each breath, with each smile, with each kiss. And when I die you can crank your watch, restart your clocks, begin the time. And know that we were infinite in the moment, that you were mine.
